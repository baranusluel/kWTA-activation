**Baran Usluel, Ilya Golod**

**CS4803/7643 Spring 2020 Final Project and candidate for ICLR Reproducibility Challenge**

Implementing [k-WTA activation function](https://github.com/a554b554/kWTA-Activation) as described in
["Enhancing Adversarial Defense by k-Winners-Take-All"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10510) @ ICLR 2020
by Chang Xiao, Peilin Zhong and Changxi Zheng.

Reproducing empirical results (test accuracy and adversarial robustness) across different network architectures
and adversarial attacks as shown in the paper. Testing with several unexplored environments as well.
